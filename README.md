# betterspotifyparty

A project inspired by the lacklustre implementation by both discord and spotify, of a way to listen to music collaboratively. Whilst sites exist, they are often restrictive, slow, or lack features.

# The Aim
To allow friends and family in remote areas to connect via music, without bloat or delay
To provide a better alternative to other publically available projects, at no cost to the end user

# Issues
There are no issues the non existant code is flawless

# Updates
N/A

# Requests
fugg off we need to build it first
